<p>
    A place of storage, dark and deep,<br>
    Where ancient stories lay asleep.<br>
    A realm of dust and whispers low,<br>
    Where memories of time will grow.
</p>
<p>
    The shelves are old, with tales untold,<br>
    And secrets kept, within the folds.<br>
    The dust that coats each precious book,<br>
    Hides secrets in each little nook.
</p>
<p>
    The whispers, low, but oh so clear,<br>
    Of tales that fill you up with fear.<br>
    The stories from the days of yore,<br>
    Are held within these ancient doors.
</p>
<p>
    And if you dare to venture in,<br>
    A world of wonder, you'll begin.<br>
    For hidden in the dusty stacks,<br>
    Are treasures that you can unpack.
</p>
